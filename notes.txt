what is Eloquent:
    - an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database.
    - each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table.
    - Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table.
what is Fillable:
    - fillable property is used to specify which attributes are mass assignable (fields that can be updated).
what is Guarded:
    - guarded property is used to specify which attributes are not mass assignable (fields that can't be updated).

Migrations - Database schema
    - php artisan make:migration create_users_table -> create a migration file
    - php artisan migrate -> run all migrations
    - php artisan migrate:rollback -> rollback the last migration
    - php artisan migrate:reset -> rollback all migrations - run down() method for each migration file
    - php artisan migrate:fresh -> roll back all migrations and run all migrations again - drop and re-create all tables

DataBase Relationships:
    - one to one -> this is mean that one user has only one profile
    - one to many -> this is mean that one user can have many posts
    - many to many -> this is mean that one user can have many roles and one role can have many users

Lazy Loading Problems:
    - when you load a relationship, the relationship is not loaded immediately. Instead, the relationship is loaded when you access the relationship's property.

Eager Loading:
    - when you load a relationship, the relationship is loaded immediately.

Example:
$users = User::all();   // 1 Query

foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts->count(); // Query لكل User
}
// N+1 Query

Pagination:
    - paginate() method is used to paginate the results of a query.
    -simplePaginate() method is used to paginate the results of a query and return simple pagination links.
    - cursorPaginate() method is used to paginate the results of a query using cursors.

Factories:
    - factories are used to generate fake data for testing purposes.
    Generating Factories:
        - php artisan make:factory FactoryName
    How to use Factories:
        1 - link the factory to the model
            - in the factory file add use App\Models\ModelName
    - the model must have use HasFactory trait to use factories
    - in the controller use factory to generate fake data in create() method

API:
    - API is an application programming interface that allows two applications to talk to each other.

Routes:
    - Get: to get data from the server - display data
    - Post: to send data to the server - create data
    - Put: to update data on the server - update data
    - Patch: to update a specific field of a resource - update data
    - Delete: to delete data from the server - delete data

HTTP Standard:
    - GET: to retrieve data from the server
    - POST: to send data to the server
    - PUT: to update data on the server
    - PATCH: to update a specific field of a resource
    - DELETE: to delete data from the server

HTTPS -> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
    - example: https://127.0.0.1:80000/home
        - https -> the protocol
        - 127.0.0.1 -> the ip address
        - 80000 - > the port number
            - what is port number?
                - a port number is a number that identifies a specific application on a computer network.
        - home -> the route

Resource Controllers:
    - resource controllers are used to create controllers that handle all the CRUD operations for a specific resource.
    - CRUD -> Create, Read, Update, Delete
    - example:
        - php artisan make:controller PostController --resource
        - this will create a controller for posts with all the CRUD operations.
    - How to use it in routes:
        - Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);
